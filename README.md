All HTML and CSS files were tested using the [W3 HTML Validator website](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3 Jigsaw CSS Validator website](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  

All code passes correctly through the validator except where HTML pages include 'Jinja Template Language' code for interaction with Django/Python variables and logic.  This is normal and to be expected.

A number of issues highlighted by the 'Pylint' system in Gitpod also require investigation.


## Bugs and issues

**Current Known Issues**

- Confirmation emails following purchases are not currently being sent to the user.  This may be to do with 'webhook' issues to the Stripe payment platform although this is yet to be confirmed/investigated.
 
- When editing reviews, the product image does not display on screen. Instead, the placeholder image is displayed.

- The 'footer' section merges into the bottom of the 'Product Details' and 'Product Review' pages.

- The 'shopping-bag' icon in the Navbar on Tablet and Mobile screens appears out of line when deployed via Heroku, but is inline when deployed via Github in Development mode.  Requires investigation.

- When adjusting the quantity of an item in the shopping bag, where the the item has a 'size' option, the size is not saved after the amendment and instead displays as blank (ie. 'Size   ').

Due to time constraints it has not been possible investigate/correct these issues at the present time so are to be corrected at a later date.



## Deployment

The application has been deployed using Github, Heroku, Amazon AWS and Stripe and can be replicated via the following process:

### Part 1.  Github & Heroku

1. Log in to Github and clone the e-volve-retail repository to your local machine. Instructions can be found here: 

    https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository


2. Install the packages listed in the 'requirements.txt' file using the following command. Ensure you are on the same directory level as the 'requirements.txt' file before commencing:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. Log in to the Heroku website (or create a new account if required).
4. From the main 'Dashboard' click 'New', then 'Create New App'.
5. Give the app a name (in this case 'e-volve-retail') and select the nearest region.
6. Click 'Create App'
7. Click the 'Resources' tab
8. In the 'Add-ons' search bar type 'postgres' and click on the 'Heroku Postgres' option in order to provision a new Postgres database in which to store your models and databases.
9. Select the 'Hobby Dev - Free' plan if you don't have a plan already.
10. Click 'Provision'.

11. Run migrations in order to migrate the data to the new 'Postgres' database:
    python3 manage.py migrate

12. Import the 'categories.json' and 'products.json' data files to Postgres.
    
    It is important to do them in this order as the products rely on the categories being in place first:

    python3 manage.py loaddata categories

    python3 manage.py loaddata products

13. Create 'superuser' for the Postgres database:

    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    
    provide:

    Username, email and password

14. Login to Heroku via the CLI:

    heroku login -i

    enter your Heroku email and password login details

15. Temporarily disable 'COLLECTSTATIC' files so that Heroku won't try to collect static files upon deployment:

    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app e-volve-retail

16. Add the 'Host Name' of the Heroku app to the 'Allowed Hosts' section of the 'settings.py' file:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['e-volve-retail.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
